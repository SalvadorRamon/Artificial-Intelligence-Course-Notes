# Reinforcement Learning
*This whole note is under review. The following text is only a draft.*

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the study of agents that learn how to achieve some goal by maximizing rewards. It's inspired by the punishment and pleasure mechanisms present in animals, including humans. A living being, using its sensors to get signals from the environment, learn from experience the actions that should be done and the ones that should be avoided, all without a detailed prior model of how the environment works. RL builds up on this idea to create intelligent algorithms.

Reinforcement Learning is considered a third paradigm of [Machine Learning](machine-learning.md), besides supervised and unsupervised learning. It's not supervised because the agent doesn't have access to a previous labeled dataset where it can learn. It's also not unsupervised because it's not purely trying to find patterns in unlabeled data.
